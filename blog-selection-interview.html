                            Hello there, I know what is your situation now! An Interview call letter is in your hand specifying location and date of Interview probably in very next week... Don't worry. Keep yourself calm &amp; cool.<br>I know how much important it is to know experience of someone. So here we go...
                        </p>
                        <blockquote><strong>
                            Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change.
                        </strong>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        This is one of my favorite quotes by Stephen Hawking.<br>I believe in this. We, human beings are made to be adaptable to number of situations. And our Intelligence is what makes it easier.<br>I don't wanna go philosophical here. But this thing is most important in any Interview, isn't it? You are just going to market yourself in-front of few people based on your Abilities and Intelligence. If you know who you are and how to express/explain yourself, believe me you are in! It's purely an ART. Yes, marketing yourself is the ART. <br><br>Ok ok, <em>Bohot ho gaya philosophy</em>. Let me head straight to my Interview experience.<br>It was scheduled at 9 am. I managed to reach at 8:55 am. An improper sitting arrangement by host college made me disappointed at the beginning itself, <em>anyways khud ko sambhalna pada.</em>. At very beginning of the interview session, two of HRs came, among them one was foreigner :-). They just gave very short introduction and told there will be no negotiation in salary at all. And soon interview session started, one after the another. I was so unfortunate that my Technical interview was conducted at 5 pm. I was too damn frustrated by then. Whatever...<br>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Technical Interview:</strong> I was little nervous while entering interview room. There were two HR managers. And fortunately both were from Electronics background. They asked for my Resume and started questioning. First question,<strong> "Favorite subject ?"</strong>. I said, "Digital." Then he asked, <strong>"How will you design a D flip-flop using a SR flip-flop."</strong>  I answered it.I know this is damn easy question, but wait it is just a start. Then he asked, <strong>"8086 is a microprocessor or micro-controller?"</strong> OMG, really. I answered it too. But now onwards they jumped on my project. But every question they asked was purely logical. What I mean is, they considered my project as a Product (it was an Universal Digital Library, just like audio book stuff but with MATLAB). They asked, <strong>"How will you market this? What will be the advantages to user? How authors of books will earn?"</strong><br>Every single question was logical, don't you think so? I somehow managed to answer these questions in my way. I'm pretty sure that, it was not at all good. I was unable to convince them. But that was OK. I was responding at least. I was defending myself. Now they moved on.<br>One HR suddenly asked, <strong>"Do you like IC's?"</strong> I said, "Yes, of course. I'm an Electronics Engg and Hobbiest too." Then he asked, <strong>"Is there any IC manufacturing company/plant in INDIA?"</strong> Terrific question. I failed. I simply said, "Sir, I don't have any knowledge about it :-(." (By the way, there is no IC manufacturing plant in INDIA yet except few in iSRO n DRDO.) Believe me, if you think you are pro in your field, just forget it. Yes, they will find something that you never heard of even! Really!!! But don't get disappoint if you don't know the answer. And don't hesitate to say, <strong>"Sorry sir I don't know."</strong> Just be true as much as possible. In Technical Interview, it is not at all about <strong>answering correct</strong>, It is just about <strong>answering</strong>. At least try to speak something logically.<br>*** This was my case. Exactly reverse happened with one of my friends (Mechanical), even though he was good in programming, his interview went terrifically wrong. So, in short you may be lucky to get good HRs as I had or <em>bhagwan bachaye!!!</em> <br>I observed, one of the  HRs, was constantly updating something about me online on there network. Those were comments and scores which were available to HRs of next stage. Everything online. That's it. Tech Interview over. Within half an hour they announced results and I went through.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Personal Interview:</strong>I guess it was 6:30 pm. I was in the queue. While waiting for my turn, I was able to see one of the Interview rooms through glass door. Really you won't believe I saw, one guy was asked to do push ups. Literally!!! <em>phatke hat mai aa gai thi.</em> Thank GOD, my interview was not in that room.<br>And my turn came. I went in. She (only one HR) asked my name and found my profile in there online directory. And within next 10 sec, without even asking any background details, she asked, <strong>"What will you do, even being in TCS; IBM, FB, GOOGLE offer you a job?"</strong> Booommmm. <em>Jitni Innocent dikh rahi thi utni thi nahi :-(.</em> I really don't know, why I answered in this way, "Definitely I'll join them, provided they are paying more than you do!"  and she was happy with my answer. Then she asked little about myself, Strengths and Extra Curricular activities.<br>Further, she demanded for my Resume. And this was the most embarrassing moment. My Resume had spelling mistakes. Not just one but <em>teen teen.</em> She gave me plane paper and asked to write those words one by one. She asked to leave my phone on the table and go outside and ask someone sitting outside for spellings. F**ked up. I mean totally......!!!<br>I went back. Now she asked, <strong>"Who is Prime minister of India?"</strong> I literally took 5 to 8 seconds to answer this. I don't know why my brain stopped working. But I answered, Mr MODI! I couldn't even recall his first name :-(. This generally happens in stress and nervousness. She still wanted to check me, she asked, <strong>"Who is CM of Maharashtra?"</strong> I answered it within seconds.<br>Then she asked, <strong>"How were your last two rounds"</strong>, she meant Apti And Technical Interview. I said, they were awesome with confidence. Because They were literally awesome. And finally she said, <strong>"It's your Apti and Tech HR can save you now."</strong> and she checked all my marksheets, certificates etc and finally asked to check mail regularly for result.<br>I was not at all expecting Offer Letter. But I was damn fortunate. <br><br>To summarize, Try to be true and manage yourself in stress and nervous conditions too. Use simple English or may be Hindi sometimes. And have some good food or snacks before Interview.
