                            To begin with <strong>my experience @ TCS interview</strong>, I would like to share the biggest mistake I committed, I registered twice at next step portal, first time I didn’t clear the written test, So I registered again but entered wrong email address so I didn’t receive any mail that I cleared the aptitude test. But my goodness, <strong>TCS</strong> found my email id in first registration and anyhow I received mail stating that immediately after two days I’d to report for interview process. So please be careful while entering your email address.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        On the interview day, I was sitting in a hall, waiting for my turn. I got to know from others that panel no. 7 is very tough at interviewing for Technical and Managerial rounds and soon I was called for the same panel. There were two panelists. As soon as I entered into the room, one of them asked me for the registration ID. I opened my application form and looked for it, as I never memorized it. Immediately he said not to look in the form and asked -<br>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> - Why are you looking in application form, don’t you remember your id? Till now several times you needed to enter it. What you did at those times?<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> - I used to look into my application and copy it from there.<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> - Do you have any memory problem? <br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> – No.<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> – Tell me your highest percentage in degree.<br><br>

                        <strong>Me </strong>– 73%.<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> -  HSC?<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> – 87%<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> -  SSC?<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> – 91%<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> – I can see that your graph is continuously decreasing in academics. Is there any significant reason. You could’ve scored more in degree.<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong>  – I don’t think my academic performance is bad. I know there was a scope to score more but I’ve maintained my degree above 70% i.e. in first division while doing this I also concentrated on my curricular and extracurricular activities for personal development. <br><br>

                        
                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> – What kind of activities they were? Did you raise money?<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> – I was the Head Event Coordinator of a college forum, where we used to conduct various competitions, events, workshops and guest lecture for students.<br>(I appeared for the drive conducted specially for recent pass outs, almost after 7-8 months from the completion of my degree.)<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> - After completion of degree you completely passed your time doing nothing. (he asked in interrogating sense and tone was sarcastic with dreadful expressions on face)<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> – No, sir. I utilized it for learning few subjects like VLSI. (As I’m from electronics background)<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 2</strong> - Long form of VLSI? (This person was constantly observing the way I talk, my body language and my facial expressions.) <br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> – Very large scale integration.<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> – Do you know any development languages?<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> –  I know programming languages like C and HTML.<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong>– Write C program to print Fibonacci series.<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> – I’ll tell you the logic.(As I am not  that strong at syntax)<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> – What’s the use of it. Write the program.
                        (I wrote the program and interviewer 2 checked it.)<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 2</strong> – You’ve written the whole program correctly.<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> -  You know, actually you’re scared. <br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> – Not at all, sir.  I’m really weak at syntax but strong at applying logics. Even now I can show you my mistakes. (At two places semicolon was missing. I honestly drawn their attention to my mistakes.)<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 2</strong> – Don’t worry. Editor will take care of it. Do you know difference between SR and JK flip flop?<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> – There occurs forbidden condition if inputs at S and R both are high. This has been overcome in JK flip flop.<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 2</strong> – Draw both of them 
                        (I constructed both flip flops correctly)<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> – What was your final year project?<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong>  – Design and development of circular monopole antenna for……….
                        (He interrupted me and started relevant questioning)
                        Interviewer 1 asked me about types of antennas, difference between parabolic and cassegrain antenna,  feeding technique od cassegrain antenna. I answered all the questions correctly accept one.<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> –Did you ever try for any other company?<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> – Yes, sir.<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> – Didn’t they find you good enough to hire?<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> – I appeared for KPIT, Technologies and cleared Technical interview.  <br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> – Then why are you here? Rather you should wait for their joining. Instead of giving you offer, we’ll give this chance to a fresher and do charity. (His face turned red and suddenly the interview room changed into horror house.)
                        (I tried to maintain my balance and calmly answered.)<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> – I’m also a fresher and I don’t have any guarantee that I‘ll receive joining from last company. <br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> –Don’t you trust your company?<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> –They’ve clearly mentioned in my Offer of Intent that they reserve all the rights to cancel this offer anytime without intimating me. So if they cancel my offer without any information, I can’t claim them.<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> –How much they are paying you?<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> –They’ll be paying 2.8LPA<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> – Do you know how much TCS will pay?<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> – Around 3.1 LPA<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> – Who told you? Did you read it on TCS official site?<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> –Many of my seniors and friends told me who are already working with TCS.<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> –So just for few thousands you are ready to leave your company. I’ll pay you 1.8LPA only. I’ll write a note on your resume stating the same. Now say, will you work?<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> – Money drives the world. So I’ll definitely think of money.<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> – Other companies are ready to hire me at higher packages, still I’m working with TCS. Can you tell me why?<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> – Probably the area of your work in TCS is of your interest and gives you satisfaction.<br><br>

                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> – So besides money, doesn’t it matter for you?<br><br>

                        <strong>Me</strong> – Definitely it matters to me.<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> – OK. I’ll pay you 1.8 LPA, in your area of interest with 3 years of bond. Now again say, will you work?<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Me</strong> – Why not? If I’m getting a chance to work in my area of interest, then 1.8 LPA is also fine. Because the ultimate thing is satisfaction.<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Interviewer 2</strong> – What do you mean by satisfaction? Less work, more work, challenging work, no work, near to family, away from family and friends? What? (Till now this man was playing role of listener and he suddenly took interest in interviewing me.)<br><br>
                        
                  S      <strong>Me</strong> – None of these parameter I take into consideration while defining Satisfaction. The only thing I consider is the work environment where I can learn new things with freedom of experimentation and where I can interact with different types of people.<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> –  But why did you let us know about your previous placement? You could’ve lied.<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Me</strong> – I didn’t want to hide anything and become dishonest with you.<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> – We would never be able to figure it out, if you would’ve hidden it.
                        (In front of me they asked a boy to call his exgirlfriend.)<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Me</strong> – Sir, just now you asked previous candidate to call his ex-girlfriend and say, “I love you”. You could’ve said me too to open my gmail account and very easily you would’ve figured it out.<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> – C’mon, why would I ask you to do so? You are a girl. He was a boy so I asked him to perform such task.<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Me</strong> – Sir, I don’t know on which parameter you assign the tasks, whether he is a boy or I’m a girl.<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong> – Now if I ask you to jump out of the window of this room, will you?
                        (He asked me this question at the point of peak pressure.)<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Me</strong> – Definitely, if by doing this your company is getting some benefits without my parent getting suffered then I’m ready to do this. <br><br>
                        (As soon as I finished my answer, both of them started talking to each other in hindi. One said to the other, “Yar isko tcs me le lea to tehelka kar dalegi (off course in sarcastic sence.)” ) <br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Interviewer 1</strong>  – O.k. You are done for the day. You may wait outside for results of this round.<br><br>

                        I thanked both of them and walked outside the room. Within next 2 minutes interviewer 1 came and said, “Previous candidate come again.” And walked outside the room. I again entered that room again. This time only Interviewer 2 interviewed me.<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Interviewer 2</strong> – I’ll ask you only technical questions, you have to answer with speed. It’ll be like rapid fire round. Are you ready?<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Me</strong> – Yes sir. (I took a long breath and said confidently.)<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Interviewer 2</strong> – How good are you in Mathematics?<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Me</strong> – Good enough.<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Interviewer 2</strong> – What is β function?<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Me</strong> – I’ve read this somewhere in 1st or 2nd year math, but I don’t recall it. I need to brush up.  <br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Interviewer 2</strong> – Which  was your favorite subject in Engineering which you can explain me in fluent English without stopping anywhere?<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Me</strong> – 8085 Microprocessor. (I started explaining 8085 right from architecture and continued till he asked me to stop i.e. for 5-6 mins. I deliberately focused on important points which to suggest that my concepts of 8085 are quite clear.)<br><br>
                        
                        Interviewer 2 asked few technical questions like definition of modulation, different modulation techniques, explanation of pulse modulation, difference between pulse position and pulse width modulation, modulation techniques used in T.V., Thevenins theorem, superposition theorem, star-delta combinations.<br><br>
                        
                        I answered most of these questions and honestly admitted wherever I was not in the position to answer. This was all about my 1st round. After 15 mins they declared that I cleared Technical round and soon I was called for personal interview.<br><br>

                        I entered in the interview room for personal interview. It was just like a formal conversation. <br><br>

                        Interviewer 3 asked me to introduce myself, enquired about my family background, verified all my academic details from my documents. He asked me whether I am comfortable with night shifts, extra work hours, any work location across India etc. Few questions where he judged me are-<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Interviewer 3</strong> – Are you an individual worker or a team player?<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Me</strong> – I can work individually, but I’ll like to work in a team.<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Interviewer 3</strong> – Which role will you play in a team, team leader, just a listener, or you will like to follow the instructions given by leader?<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Me</strong> – It is not necessary that one person can have any one of above qualities. I can perform all the jobs that you mentioned but I’ll like to lead the team.<br><br>
                        
                        Then he informed about clauses and few policies of TCS and asked to check the mail regularly.<br>
